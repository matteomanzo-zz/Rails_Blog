#Rails Blog

## What is it?

This app is a simple blog created using Rails, following [this](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) tutorial.

## Technologies Used

- Ruby on Rails
- HTML & CSS
- Sqlite3

## Still to complete

- [ ] CSS

## Takeaway

As this is my first app that I'm creating using Rails, I wasn't use to the "Convention over Configuration".
The MVC pattern really helps following the Single Responsibility Principle, as it keeps the models, views and controllers separated and so easier to edit.
